This is my code for assignment 2 in OOP course at BCIT

In this assignmnent, I will design and develop the Game of Life which simulates a world with Plants and Herbivores. 

Part A of the assignment includes design, basic world and layout, response to a user mouse click.

Part B of the assignment includes proper use of Polymorphic behaviour, class use and inheritance is required and is the focus of the assignment. In this assignment A2b, there is more lifeForm added into the Game and the reproducing method of each Lifeform is different now. I am working on this milestone

Part C of the assignment includes final installment of the GOL. It will test my design's flexibility. Details will be provided after A2b has been completed.

As I am not working on part C, I will continue updating this README.md
